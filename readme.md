# Solitaire game application:
The group has decided to create a card game application that allows a user to prepare and play a Solitaire game. This application will have user interaction that allows them to login to their account, play a game in single/multiplayer mode, host a new game for others to join, and so on.
The program will consist of, but not limited to the following functions:
*Prepare a Solitaire game
*A collection of solitaire games that has been configured
*Methods to modify prepared games by altering its parameters
*Methods to check the information of prepared games
*Series of methods that correspond to basic game rules and mechanics in a solitaire game (i.e., number of cards drawn each time, the win condition, restrictions on which cards you can put down, etc.)
*Series of methods that correspond to basic player action in a solitaire game (i.e., drawing cards, selecting cards, putting down cards on the field/slots, etc.)
*A data collection that keeps track of player post-game results (records of time it took for the player to solve/win), along with graphical representation of the data
*A user interface for players to prepare, host and play the actual game.
*Use of an API to access basic gameplay mechanic of a poker game(includes shuffle, draw, reshuffle, add to piles, return cards to deck, get new/partial deck)
